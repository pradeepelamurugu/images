1) Write a Program to implement Linear Regression (Scikit) involving single variable
and multiple variables and analyze the house price prediction.

import pandas as pd 
import numpy as np 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
import seaborn as sns

data=pd.read_csv('real_estate.csv')

data.head()

data.info()

data.columns

x=data[['X3 distance to the nearest MRT station']]
y=data['Y house price of unit area']

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(x,y,train_size=0.85,random_state=1)

model =LinearRegression()
model.fit(x_train, y_train)

y_pred = model.predict(x_test)

mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'The test MSE is {mse}')
